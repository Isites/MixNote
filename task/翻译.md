#在Android设备上通过检测用户的行为，来调整预防发出恶意短信

> Abstract: In this paper, we propose OnDroid, a prevention system to defend against outgoing malicious SMS in Android devices. OnDroid is user-friendly as it considers the user's little understanding of the Android system. It also considers multiple threat scenarios and requires less interaction with the user. For each SMS-sending operation , OnDroid first checks if the mobile device state mismatches the user's behavior. If so, the operation is blocked. Otherwise, it is delayed for a while and the user is notified to confirm or reject the operation. If the SMS is considered normal, the user does not need to take any action and the SMS is sent when the delay expires. Efficiency analysis shows that malicious SMS operations might be missed when the user is unavailable. To  deal with this issue, we propose a method by which the user behavior can be adjusted to achieve 100% of malicious SMS prevention. Formal analysis as well as comparative study show that OnDroid offers a good tradeoff between security efficiency and usability.

摘要：在本文中，我们提出了一个Android设备上的、可以防止发出恶意短信的防御系统，并命名为OnDroid。OnDroid 是用户友好的，因为它不仅考虑了用户对Android系统知之甚少，而且考虑了多种和用户交互较少的威胁场景。每次发送短信时，OnDroid 首先检查移动设备的状态是否符合用户行为，如果不符合，则阻塞发送。否则，短信发送将被延迟并通知用户，让用户来确认或者拒绝该操作。如果短信被认为是正常的，则用户不需要采取任何行动，至到延时结束后短信将被发送。`效益分析表明，当用户不可用的时候，发送恶意短信可能会被错过。为了解决这个问题 我们提出了一个方法，通过调整用户的行为，来实现100%的防范恶意短信。正式的分析和比较研究表明，OnDroid 在安全性和易用性之间取得了良好的平衡。`

> Introduction: The Android operating system is largely popular among mobile device users. According to some several reports (Mawston, July 2014; http://www.idc.com/prodse), Android dominated the Smartphone market with a share of 85% and 82.8% in the second quarter of 2014 and 2015 respectively. Due to this popularity, it has been highly targeted by malware developers, which aim at profiting financially by infecting a large number of mobile devices. A study (Maslennikov, February 2014) has shown that Android acounts for 98.05% of mobile threats. According to F-secure report (Labs, April 2014), 99% of the emerged threats, which were discovered in the first quarter of 2014, were designed to run on the Android operating system. F-secure also reported in 2013 that 81.1% of the mobile malware were financially-motivated and 97.14% of the latter targeted Android OS (Labs, November 2013). Most of the financially-motivated malware perform SMS-sending activities during their attacks. This fact was supported by a report published in 2014 (Labs, April 2014). The report showed that 83% of the Android malwares analyzed by F-secure were performing SMS-sending activities, also called SMS-based attacks. These attacks are charged to the victims's account without his/her consent or knowledge, and can take the following forms:

引言：Android操作系统在移动设备用户中广泛流行。据几份报告(Mawston，2014年7月；http://www.idc.com/prodse)显示，Android在智能手机市场占据主导地位，在2014和2015年的第二季度其市场份额分别为85%和82.8%。归咎于其流行程度，Android 平台    。一项研究(Maslennikov，2014年2月)表明，Android占据移动设备威胁的98.05%。F-secure公司报告(Labs，2014年4月)称，2014年第一季度发现的威胁中，99%为Android操作系统设计的。F-secure公司还报告称，在恶意软件中，81.1%是以金钱为动机的，其97.14%的目标是Android系统(Labs，2013年11月)。大部分的恶意软件通过发送短信来进行攻击行为。这一事实的有力支撑者是一篇2014年刊登的报告（Labs，2014年4月）。该报告显示，F-secure分析的Android 恶意软件中，83%表现为发送短信，也称为基于短信的攻击。这些攻击在没有用户的同意或了解的情况下就得到受害者的账户信息。其攻击方式可以采取以下几种方式：

> * SMS Spam: It is an unsolicited message sent from the compromised mobile device to advertise goods and products. The spammers send instructions to the compromised devices to launch SMS spam campaigns(Cloudmark, March 2014).
>
> * SMS Premium rate fraud: The malware sends an SMS to a premium rate number, which results in transferring costly sums from the user's account to that of the cybercriminal(Labs, April 2014).
>
> * SMS malware propagation: The malware sends an SMS containing links to malicious applications in order to infect the recipient devices.
>
> * SMS privacy attack: Some malware secretly send through SMS sensitive information stored at the device to the attacker such as: bank account, phone identifiers (IMES, IMSI), and GPS location.
>
> * SMS flooding attack: Many unauthorized SMSs are generated to attack a target, which might lead to a Denial-of-Service(Dos) (Traynor et al., 2009)
